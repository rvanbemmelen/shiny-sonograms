# shiny-sonograms

R Shiny apps to create sonograms while in the field or identify olive-backed/tree pipits. Heavily using the seewave package.

## to-do/ideas

- maybe have a button to press before sono is renewed?
- maybe have the option to save sono as PNG besides JPEG?
- maybe have av as the default and seewave as an option? Would speed up things, but sonos might be of less quality?
- once Ralphs' new tree pipit paper/shinyapp has been published, delete/adjust mine
